# Getting started

If you want to use the theme in your own [hugo](https://gohugo.io) website just `clone` the repo to your `theme` directory and add it to your `config.toml` file.

```toml
theme = "devRes"
```

# Features

- Responsive layout.
- Light / Dark mode.
- [Plausible](https://plausible.io) analytics.

# Customization

1. You can change the theme colors in the `config.toml` file.
2. Your resume data should be added in the `data/content.yaml` file.

You can check the `exampleSite` directory for an example.

# Want to help?

Great! All issues and pull requests are welcome.

For local development just copy all the files to the `exampleSite` directory, navigate to it and just start [hugo](https://gohugo.io) with `hugo server -D`.
