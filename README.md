## Getting started

If you want to use the theme in your own [hugo](https://gohugo.io) website just `clone` the repo to to your `themes` directory or `add` it as a submodule.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:nirgn975/devRes.git themes/devRes
```

or

```bash
$ git submodule add git@github.com:nirgn975/devRes.git themes/devRes
```

And then add it to your `config.toml` file

```toml
theme = "devRes"
```

You can look at the [exampleSite](https://github.com/nirgn975/devRes/tree/main/exampleSite) to check out the `config.toml` and the `data/content.yaml` for examples.

## Customization

1. You can change the theme colors in the `config.toml` file.
2. Your resume data should be added in the `data/content.yaml` file.
3. Your favicons should go in an `icons` directory inside `static`. You can easily generate them with [realfavicongenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net), and set theme-color and background-color in `browserconfig.xml` and `site.webmanifest`.

You can check the `exampleSite` directory for an example.

## Want to help?

Great! All issues and pull requests are welcome.

For local development just start [hugo](https://gohugo.io) with `exampleSite` as the source.

```bash
$ hugo server --source=exampleSite -v --gc
```
